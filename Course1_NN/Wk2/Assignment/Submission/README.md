## Python Basics with numpy (optional)
Welcome to your first (Optional) programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this assignment you will:

- Learn how to use numpy.

- Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, dsigmoid, etc...

- Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.

- Recognize the importance of vectorization.

- Understand how python broadcasting works.

## Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Welcome to the first (required) programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!

As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on <strong>cat vs. non-cat</strong> datasets. By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
