# Keras tutorial - Emotion Detection in Images of Faces

Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:
1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. 
2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.

# Residual Networks

Welcome to the second assignment of this week! You will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

**In this assignment, you will:**
- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets. 
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
