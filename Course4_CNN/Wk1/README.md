## Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step
Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! 
In this assignment, you will:
   - Implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.

## Convolutional Neural Networks: Application
Welcome to Course 4's second assignment! In this notebook, you will:

   - Implement helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model
   - Implement a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow

After this assignment you will be able to:

Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem
